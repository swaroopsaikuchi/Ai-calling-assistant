I recommend reaching out to the salon directly to address your concerns and to discuss any potential reimbursement for your appointment. Also, the cost and amount of weight lost during a trim varies depending on the length and thickness of your hair. It would be best to discuss this with your stylist during your appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Additionally, the appointment date and time provided are not valid, as there is no 13am and February 31st does not exist.
